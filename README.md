# light-source
A light weight and easy to use jQuery plugin that creates a light source and shadow for elements within a defined viewport. The mouse cursor position acts as the position of the light source.

To get started simply clone or download the project, and inlcude the `light-source.js` file in between the `<head>` tags of your html document using the markup below.

`<script src='light-source.js'></script>`

Make sure to include your jQuery library before light-source.

to get started, simply call `lightSource()` on any element on your web page.

example:
`$('.myElement').lightSource();`

There will me more updates to come on how to set options.
